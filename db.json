Let it cool completely - potatoes cooked in a hurry on the same day do not become a real salad!\n\nTo make a salad, peel boiled potatoes and chop into small cubes. Cut the boiled cooled eggs into small cubes or crush them with a fork. Chop the cucumber into small cubes. Chop the onion or leek very finely (if desired, soak the chopped onion in a little cold water, it will soften the taste). Chop the sausage into small cubes.\n\nThe sauce should be mixed in a separate bowl. Mix sour cream, mayonnaise and mustard. Add chopped dill, onion tops, salt and pepper (the more summertime, the more I add herbs). Pour the sauce over the salad ingredients and mix gently.\n\nBefore serving, let the salad season in the pantry for about 2-4 hours.",
